<h3>Used Rough Terrain Forklift Browning MT</h3>

<p>Safety features of this forklift truck include a high-visibility overhead guard, an emergency power disconnect switch, electric horn, and an anti-static ground strap. Manual pallet jacks have existed since at least 1918. Heavy loads and the shifting center-of-gravity can tip a forklift over if it goes too fast. For intricate indoor operations, reach forklift trucks can provide drivers with another set of eyes when they are handling a robust inventory.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these rough terrain forklifts double as workhorses in the bush here in Australia. The test load should be equivalent to an unrestrained, homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension, and should equal in weight to the rated capacity of the truck. Similar to a reach truck, the electric variety is only for indoor use.</p>
