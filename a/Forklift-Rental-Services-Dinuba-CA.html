<h2>Industrial Forklift Trucks Dinuba </h2>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>The G2 features a 4 inch elevated off road suspension lift, custom G2 wheels, and 33 inch all-terrain tires. Included in this class are lift trucks with 3 or 4 wheels and either cushion (solid) or pneumatic (air filled) tires. Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions. A lifted truck can provide you with greater ground clearance beneath your truck, even if you choose a simple lift kit, which can help you with going off-road with your pickup.</p>
<p>The idea behind it is always the same: Every pallet truck from Linde should be able to be controlled effortlessly with only one hand.
