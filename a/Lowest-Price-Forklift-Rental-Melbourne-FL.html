Check the areas around and behind your vehicle before putting it in reverse, even if that means you need to temporarily turn the truck off, hop down out of the driver's seat and do a quick check for any children or pedestrians in the area.</p>

Moreover, an optical sensor mounted on the load section can automatically lower pallets to an ideal working height.</p>
