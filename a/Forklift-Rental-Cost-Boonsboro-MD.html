In the region where I work, small businesses (as opposed to the large manufacturing and commercial construction companies I normally consult with) often lack the resources for safety training. The industrial forklift —also called a large capacity forklift—combines the functionalities of a warehouse forklift with that of a telehandler.</p>

The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages. These kits cannot be installed in vehicles with a unibody construction, such as the Jeep Cherokee.</p>
