<p>Industrial counterbalance forklifts are the most common trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores. Luckily, there are plenty of other ways to improve forklift stability. That's why we have forklifts and forklift parts for available. HIGH-LIFT TRUCK: A self-loading truck equipped with an elevating mechanism designed to permit tiering.

<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
