Whether you are a grocer challenged by better space utilization, a pharmaceutical distribution center dominated by narrow aisles or even a paper warehouse managing multiple sized pallet loads, NWLT has the right forklift to meet your exacting standards. Ahern specializes in high reach equipment, which permits the safe lifting of people or materials to work at height.</p>

<p>On certain types of trucks, the weight on the braking wheel (s) may be insufficient to attain drawbar drag values required for higher combinations of ramp and speed. But "rough terrain" isn't simply an indication of the machine's robust nature. Turret trucks or Swing-Reach® can work in aisles as narrow as 60”, and are used for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.</p>

<p>The complexity of the operator controls, the caution with which trucks much be operated and the care required in moving heavy and sometimes precarious loads are all elements of risk with fork lift truck use.
