<p>Long Term Forklift Rentals have the advantage of providing your immediate Forklift needs and allowing your working capital to be utilized for re-investment back into your business. A body lift kit is much simpler to install - it just uses spacers underneath the cab to boost the height of the body. Our Hydraulic Pallet Trucks are used widely for their efficiency and flawless performance.</p>
<p>This mainly due to the growing demand for material handling equipment across the manufacturing industry. The 8,000 lb. electric 4-wheel is used in higher capacity operations.

<h3>Forklift Truck Courses Cleves OH</h3>

<p>The forklift is every bit as good as they said it would be. I highly recommend this company. PLS Kits are available for most of the popular vehicle applications and can be completely removed if necessary.

<p>Picking out the right lift kit height means you'll need to know a little bit more about how certain lift heights will affect your vehicle's performance and what they are generally used for. It may be necessary to travel long distances with the load to the rear in reverse for most forklifts. Frequency of use and pallet transport distance should be taken into consideration when choosing between manual and electric pallet trucks.</p>
<p>The operator hand transfers the load onto the pallet one article at a time. Powered pallet trucks operate to a very similar principle as hand-pallet trucks. We have grown from a primarily used forklift warehouse to a fully functioning forklift dealership. This is the leading cause of death involving lift trucks.
