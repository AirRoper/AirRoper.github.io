<p>Never use a diesel engine, internal combustion gas, or propane powered lift truck models in confined spaces for long periods of time. Yet large trucks can't be raised and driven safely until their brakes are modified. Conform with manufacturers requirements as per the operators handbook, other types of information source and relevant regulations and legislation.</p>

Generally, the smallest capacity cushion available, the 3,000 lb. is a light-duty truck ideal for warehouses and production lines. A lifted truck has its suspension raised and may have its engine modified to be louder, creating a true white trash experience. Constructed with either internal combustion engines or electric motors, reach trucks come in three main types: straddle reach trucks, standup reach trucks or double deep reach trucks.</p>
<p>Shall be located with the center of gravity centered 10 inches above the compressed operator's seat for sit-down trucks and centered 40 inches above the operator's platform for stand-up trucks. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test #OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when the load is raised to maximum lift height.</p>
