In honor of National Forklift Safety Day on June 12, we present our annual ranking of the 10 (actually, 11 due to a tie for 10th place) largest global manufacturers of forklifts, as ranked by revenue. Pallet jacks can bear a lot of weight, but they also have limits that cannot be safely exceeded.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about lifted trucks and you just want something from the factory that is great for going off-road, then either of these models is a great choice. Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>

If you are planning to go for one of the above kinds of pallet trucks, CUMI LIFT has a range of it, you can pick the one that most suits your needs.
