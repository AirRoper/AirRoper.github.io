<p>There are many things to consider when deciding to forklift more than a few hours every day for heavy lifting, a new although more affordable, are better suited to handle less frequent use have greater capabilities and dealers generally offer warranties with which is why most companies purchase used forklifts versus new type and the engine type you need for your application.</p>

<p>Load and unload pallets on and off trucks. I used to say, If it has forks on it and you're lifting up pallets, it's covered by the forklift standard.” But that's not 100% true anymore. Raymond counterbalanced sit down forklift trucks can use specialized load handling attachments such as slip sheets, and carton clamps. It is therefore essential to know the exact capacity and safety features of the specific forklift you are handling.</p>
