In 2018, the Chinese market maintained rapid growth, with the fork sales outnumbering 500,000 units in the first ten months of 2018 and expectedly approaching 600,000 units throughout the year.

We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

But "rough terrain" isn't simply an indication of the machine's robust nature.

<p>Similarly, a shift towards the adoption of more advanced and expensive machinery at the expense of conventional models is observed in the forklift truck market trend. Emissions from forklifts.
