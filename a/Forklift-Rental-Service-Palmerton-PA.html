<h3>Hand Pallet Truck  Palmerton PA 18071</h3>
<p>DaSilva says Stackers comparable to forklifts cost a little over $6,000, or half the price. We provide heavy-duty forklifts for moving your cargo. A rough terrain forklift is set up to deal with a number of weights and loads, but the operator is the key source who focuses on keeping everyone safe and the machine safe. Purchasing a new rough terrain lift truck can cost up to $100,000.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
