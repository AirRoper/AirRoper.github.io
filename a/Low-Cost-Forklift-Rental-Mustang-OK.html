For trucks with tilting forks, the forks shall be horizontal or at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable.

A loading plate for loading reference is usually located on the forklift. The type of load also matters as there are specific forklift attachments that can enhance a standard forklift and help you move the load more efficiently.</p>
