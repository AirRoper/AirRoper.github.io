A forklift truck is designed with protected cab for a driver and two prongs on the front to move and carry heavy loads around your factory or warehouse. The reason that these trucks are ideally suited for off road driving is that the body of the truck is protected by the fact that it's several feet away from the ground, meaning that it's less likely to come into collision with the ground or other objects on the ground.</p>
<h3>How to Determine the Value of a Used Forklift in Alexander City AL 35010</h3>
<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
