<h3>Counterbalance Forklift Truck Queensbury NY</h3>
<p>When you're buying a new forklift or pallet loader, you can discuss trading in your old material handling equipment with the sales professionals from Mid-Ohio Forklifts, Inc. Large tires and elevated suspension equal higher ground clearance and mean these trucks are better able to handle all kinds of road conditions. Counterbalanced Stackers contain no outriggers and loads (1,500 - 4,000 lbs) are counterbalanced using the overall length of the unit, plus battery weight.</p>
<p>While they can lift several times their weight, the maximum weight that they can hold is significantly lower than that of class 1 models. It is these 12 best electric pallet jack reviews that we have brought up to recommend you to consider. Especially when the bouncing effect is multiplied, because of the big lifted truck's height and beefed up suspension. Our rental offers start with expert advice.</p>

<p>The second type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit. The average pallet jack can lift about 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg).
