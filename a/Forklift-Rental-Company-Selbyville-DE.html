Meanwhile, Crown introduced a new 2-stage TL mast , commonly referred to as a Truckers Mast,” for its Crown FC 5200 Series counterbalance forklifts and the pneumatic and cushion tire models of the Crown C-5 Series industrial forklifts.</p>
<p>It's not as easy to see vehicles around your lifted truck, especially if they're smaller passenger occupant vehicles or bikes. Like an articulated forklift, a pivoting-mast forklift can rotate its mast at a 90-degree angle to its body. That's why it's nice to rent a forklift when required.
