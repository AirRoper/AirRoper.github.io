Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
<p>We replace your lead-acid battery-powered electric trucks - regardless of manufacturer or brand - with our EFG with lithium-ion batteries.
