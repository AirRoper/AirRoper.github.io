<h2>Crown Lift Trucks Negaunee</h2>
<p>These sorts of lifted trucks drive differently than stock models, due to the change of suspension and higher center of gravity, but can utilize mush larger tires than a factory model. Advances in machinery made life easier for warehouse personnel; one of these important innovations was the pallet jack, which is basically a type of forklift. Many of the most serious forklift accidents happen when a driver drops a payload.</p>
<p>When standard pallet sizes launched in 1930, forklifts became even more useful. However, to maximize the benefits you can gain from a short-term forklift rental, you need to understand lift truck rental agreements and how they align to the needs of your specific business. Affordability - Rental forklift is highly affordable; you can rent a high-capacity forklift at a very reasonable cost.</p>

Top-notch customer service and trustworthy equipment—that's why Atlas is one of the leading Toyota forklift dealers in the Chicago, IL area.
