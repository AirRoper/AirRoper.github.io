Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

Give special consideration to the proper functioning of tires, horn, lights, battery, controller, lift system (including load engaging means, chains, cable, and limit switches), brakes and steering mechanism.
