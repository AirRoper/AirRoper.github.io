Specifically, adding such a large lift kit or monstrous wheels and tires can make daily driving around the city a real chore. Identify the maximum load weight you need to lift, and rent a forklift that could support such capacity. The Black Widow is a professionally lifted truck by SCA Performance.</p>
<p>Turret Trucks are battery operated machines that use both the electric engine, battery and operator compartment to counterweigh heavy loads. Additionally Pengate rentals offer the following advantages: low rates (which include batteries and chargers); rental rates may be expensible for tax purposes; maintenance service by our Raymond Certified Technicians at no added charge; the ability to opt into a rent-to-own program.</p>

If low clearances are an issue, CASE offers freelift masts that allow you to raise the forks 5 ft off the ground prior to the mast protruding, keeping your overall travel height lower.</p>
