<p>We will deliver a fully serviced and maintained machine to your business premises or job site to take the hassle out of purchasing or hiring a forklift.

Trained drivers use the controls to turn the rough terrain forklift or to drive it forward or backward.</p>
<p>These rough terrain forklifts come with a higher ground clearance that is crucial to work on cross-country terrain. A forklift that is overloaded while lifting a load at height can very easily tip over forwards, with potential of causing serious damage to property, equipment, and people. But work can go a lot quicker if you have the right equipment to help you out—and pallet jack is one of the most convenient and efficient types of equipment out there for the job.</p>
