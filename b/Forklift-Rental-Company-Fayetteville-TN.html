<p>JCB rough terrain forklifts are a reliable, comfortable, versatile and easy-to-use solution for any challenging rehandling environment. Stability - An order picker forklift must retain its stability even when picking goods at high elevations. Heavy duty design: 4mm steel plate fork frame and largerd lift piston ensure the truck to reach rated capacity. When you want the latest and greatest in forklift tech for your business, it's typically easier to rent than buy. These mobile, self-loading trucks are power-propelled to carry, push, pull, lift, stack or tier material.</p>
<p>Completing your training and receiving your certification will only enable you to drive that specific forklift truck — any additional trucks will require you to take an entirely new course. We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

<p>Licensing prerequisites are the same for both conventional and rough terrain forklifts. If at any time a powered industrial truck is found to be in need of repair, defective, or in any way unsafe, the matter shall be reported immediately to the designated authority, and the truck shall be taken out of service until it has been restored to safe operating condition.</p>
<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>
<p>The Raymond 7000 Series reach trucks are engineered for productivity in narrow aisle applications—handling small footprints and maximum throughput needs with over 200 configurations available. If low clearances are an issue, CASE offers freelift masts that allow you to raise the forks 5 ft off the ground prior to the mast protruding, keeping your overall travel height lower.</p>
