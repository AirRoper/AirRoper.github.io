If the truck is equipped with front-end attachments other than factory installed attachments, the user shall request that the truck be marked to identify the attachments, show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination, and the capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation with load laterally centered.</p>

There are other models that have an auxiliary mast that is mounted in front of the platform with pallet forks. We offer a full line of both new and used trucks, buses and trailers. Drive and operate your rental equipment safely.

<p>The forklift is every bit as good as they said it would be. I highly recommend this company.
