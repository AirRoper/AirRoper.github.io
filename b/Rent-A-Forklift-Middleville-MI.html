Industrial Counterbalanced Forklift trucks have been used since the 1960's to aid in the transportations of heavy warehousing materials over short distances and heights.

A double mast forklift has a second mast attached to the carriage of the first mast. There's no better way to move equipment and materials around a factory or work site than with a forklift.</p>
<p>Reach forklifts exemplify these features as they can reach higher storage levels than standard models and have a better control response time. Standard 2-ton counterbalance forklifts can cost over $20,000 in good condition, and many cost much more when brought brand new.
