Depending on the quality of your shocks, you'll likely enjoy more control of your vehicle and higher ground clearance as well. We will focus on how to maintain your forklift's stability and handling, as well as how to lift loads properly.</p>

Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>
