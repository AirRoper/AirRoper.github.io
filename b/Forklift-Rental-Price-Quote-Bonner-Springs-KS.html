<p>The load of the forks must be balanced by the weight of the lift truck in order for this principle to work. These are Class 5 forklifts. A reach fork truck is primarily an indoor forklift most useful for reaching high racks. It can be used in all types of workplaces where efficient material handling is desired.

Wrap orders before loading on trucks. In North America, reach trucks are typically stand up trucks. If the operator is riding in the order picking truck, they wear a specially designed safety harness to prevent falls.</p>
<p>It's not as easy to see vehicles around your lifted truck, especially if they're smaller passenger occupant vehicles or bikes. Like an articulated forklift, a pivoting-mast forklift can rotate its mast at a 90-degree angle to its body. That's why it's nice to rent a forklift when required.
