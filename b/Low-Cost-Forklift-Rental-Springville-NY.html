<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb.

Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>161 Rule: Vehicles will not be driven in and out of trucks trailers at unloading docks until trucks are securely blocked and brakes set.

If you are a Private Individual looking to obtain a CPCS card for a Rough Terrain Forklift, the implications are very different from those of a CITB registered construction company.</p>
<p>The maximum capacity of reach forklifts is generally around 5,000 pounds. The weight of the forklift's battery can also be used to provide stability to the truck, so any change in the type of battery for the forklift can lead to instability. The Hydraulic hand Pallet trucks can handle palletised load up to 2500 Kg in a single haul and a single operator can lift and move this weight effortlessly over short distances.</p>
<p>This description refers to the type of pallet or product the jack is able to carry. Toyota Forklifts has introduced three new order pickers.
