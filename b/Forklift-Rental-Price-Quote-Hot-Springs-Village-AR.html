The rough-terrain or straight-mast forklift has become more of a niche machine, rather than an ‘everybody-needs-one' machine,” says Charlie Detrich, U.S. sales & dealer development manager for Liftking.</p>
<p>A subtype of the warehouse forklift, side loaders are usually found in steel service centers and manufacturing facilities with heavy and bulky items.
