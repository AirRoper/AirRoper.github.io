<p>Pallet trucks should be durable, not disposable. More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup. Therefore, a fork lift operator must be able to use the machine to fit large, heavy pallets into relatively small areas, such as large shelving fixtures.</p>

If you are looking to carry loads cross-country with a highly stable machine, then these forklifts are ideal. But the counterweight is larger and usually of a different design, to increase the lifting capacity.</p>
