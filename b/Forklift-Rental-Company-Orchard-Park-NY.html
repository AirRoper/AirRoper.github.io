All-terrain and off-road tires in very large sizes can be crucial for conquering particularly difficult and hazardous trails.</p>
<p>The trucks make light work of heavy loads, while the scales impress with their outstanding precision.

This is used, for example, when the tires on one side of the forklift are up on a mound of dirt and the tires on the other side are down in a rut.</p>
<h2>WI Lift, IL Material Handling, Ellis Systems, Wolter Power Orchard Park </h2>
<p>This series includes lift trucks that can lift loads from 1 t to 8 t. The models are split into three categories, starting with the 1-3,5-t models. The next huge advance in the forklift industry involved the electric engine. Our annual look at the largest global manufacturers of lift trucks ranked by revenue.

No matter what size or capacity you need, you can find a rough terrain forklift for the job. Models through 16,000 pounds lift capacity use a standard 100-horsepower engine; the next two larger models use a 142-horsepower engine; and the largest model, the LK30P44, has a 225-horsepower engine.</p>
