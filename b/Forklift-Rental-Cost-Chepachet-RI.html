<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely. Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support.

<p>Caterpillar forklifts are notoriously powerful. A parking brake (or mechanism) which may be a part of, or include the service brake(s), shall be provided and be capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 10% grade, whichever is the lesser. The innovative 3-phase motors in our electric forklifts combine powerful performance with minimal consumption of power.</p>
<p>Always drive unloaded trucks with the forks downgrade. Have brakes set and wheel blocks in place to prevent movement of trucks, trailers, or railroad cars while loading or unloading. Are you looking for a used lifted 4Ã—4 truck for sale, if so, then you came to the right place. This class includes reach trucks, in which the operator guides the fork to reach up and grab pallets, and order pickers, in which the operator platform can be raised and lowered to grab individual items when putting together an order.</p>
