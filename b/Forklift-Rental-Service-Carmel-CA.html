<p>Toyota Forklift is proud to have the biggest range of forklifts and battery-electric warehouse equipment available in South-Africa, ensuring that whatever your requirements we have a suitable material handling solution. Cat P7000: This Cat pneumatic forklift rental is available in gas and LP power source options and offers a maximum load capacity of 5,000 pounds. The low lift electric hand pallet jacks, also known as walkies” are a common type of class three forklift. We are a well-known for manufacturing, exporting, wholesaling, distributing and supplying Electric Pallet Truck, which is an efficient product of our company.</p>
<p>However, industrial-grade masts do reportedly provide more substantial lifting capacity at height, with 6,000-lb and 8,000-lb capacity lifts serving as two popular examples among a number of rental houses. Their manoeuvrability, tires and traction force make them very popular in industries where very heavy loads must be transported on rough or unpaved grounds.</p>

<p>Designed to increase productivity when handling heavy loads, the innovative and unique BT Pro Lifter model LHM230P requires up to 67% less force than a standard hand pallet truck to begin moving. Pallet jacks - also called order pickers, typical pallet jacks can lift approximately 3,300 pounds. Dayton® pallet trucks feature a cushion grip with a 3-position lever and a flow valve for controlled lowering.</p>

In addition, reach trucks offer versatile benefits in various tasks for industries such as manufacturing industries, shop floors, transportation hubs, warehouses, logistics, and factories, owing to their compact design as well as greater maneuverability capability.</p>
<p>Transmissions on forklifts, in particular, can be subject to abuse. When not used for picking, these trucks can also be used for the transport or stacking of pallets. With lift capacities of 5,000, 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, the three established G Series rough-terrain forklift models offered by Case can be equipped with two mast heights — 15 and 22 feet — to cover most applications.</p>
