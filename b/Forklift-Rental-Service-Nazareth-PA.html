<p>With high ground clearance and durable super-elastic wheels, these forklifts are ideal for working in indoor and outdoor environments. Rough terrain forklifts have the build and rugged construction to handle tough outdoor work.

<p>Crown's Smart Systems continually monitor and analyze lift truck activity to enable control of travel speed, braking, cornering speed and position hold. According to Manitou, cabs feature efficient heating and ventilation as standard, air conditioning (optional).” The company uses Shock Absorber Technology” designed to keeps the load stable in all types of terrain.</p>
