<p>They have a more powerful engine than other types of forklifts , making them reach higher and faster speeds. These types of forklifts are designed to run on a variety of fuel types, the most common being liquid propane and diesel.

<p>All parts are made of stainless including hydraulic pump, fork frame, handle, push rod, bearing, pin, and bolt, etc. Warehouses and fulfillment centers with tall and deep racking commonly use reach trucks. You will also need to know what the required turning radius is, and also, the minimum aisle width the lift truck will be working in. This will determine the kind of forklift needed to be able to maneuver through the space in which the truck is working.</p>
