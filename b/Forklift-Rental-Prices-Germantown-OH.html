We are a full-service forklift and material handling equipment dealer, proudly located in Phoenix and serving the great state of Arizona.

In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
